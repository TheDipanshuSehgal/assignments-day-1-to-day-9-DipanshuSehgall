Key Observations:
The minimum non-zero product of the numbers can be achieved by making all numbers as small as possible while ensuring they remain non-zero.
The smallest non-zero product of the numbers in the range ([1, 2^p - 1]) is achieved by making all numbers equal to (1) except for the largest number, which will be (2^p - 1).
The product of the numbers will be (1^{(2^p - 2)} \times (2^p - 1)), which simplifies to (2^p - 1).

CODE :

#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        long long maxNum = (1LL << p) - 1; // This is 2^p - 1
        long long product = maxNum; // Start with the largest number

        // Calculate the product of all numbers except the largest one
        // which is effectively 1^(2^p - 2) = 1, so we only need to consider maxNum
        // The result is maxNum % MOD
        return product % MOD;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int p = 3; // Example input
    int result = solution.minNonZeroProduct(p);

    std::cout << "The minimum non-zero product is: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}


OUTPUT : 

The minimum non-zero product is: 7
